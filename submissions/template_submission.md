## Project Title
**Anonymous Feedback System**

## Project Description    
During the hackathon, I developed an **Anonymous Feedback System**, a web application designed to allow users to submit feedback without requiring authentication. This project provides a straightforward and secure method for individuals to express their thoughts and opinions without the fear of identification.

The application consists of two primary components:

1. **User Feedback Submission**: Users can enter their feedback in a text area and submit it anonymously. This encourages honest opinions and suggestions, making it easier for organizations or teams to gather constructive criticism or praise.

2. **Admin Panel**: Admins have access to a dedicated dashboard where they can view all feedback submissions. This feature includes sorting and filtering options to manage feedback effectively, ensuring that important messages are prioritized.

The main objectives of this project were to promote open communication, enhance team collaboration, and provide valuable insights for continuous improvement.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration for this project stemmed from my experience in various team environments where feedback is essential for growth. However, many individuals often hesitate to share their opinions due to fear of judgment or repercussions. I wanted to create a platform where feedback can be shared openly and honestly, thus fostering a culture of transparency and improvement.

By providing an anonymous feedback mechanism, I aimed to empower users to voice their thoughts freely, ultimately benefiting teams and organizations by providing them with genuine insights into their performance and areas for enhancement.

## Tech Stack    
The project was built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: 
  - **React.js**: For building the user interface and managing application state efficiently.
  - **CSS**: For styling the components and creating a responsive layout.

- **Backend**: 
  - **Appwrite**: A self-hosted backend-as-a-service platform that handles authentication, database management, and storage.

- **Database**: 
  - **Appwrite Databases**: For storing feedback entries and user data securely.

## Usage of Appwrite
The project utilizes various Appwrite products to enhance its functionality:

- **Appwrite Databases**: 
  I used Appwrite Databases to store all feedback submissions. Each feedback document includes fields for the feedback text and timestamp, allowing the admin to sort and review submissions effectively.

- **Appwrite Account**: 
  This feature is implemented to manage admin authentication. The admin panel is protected, ensuring that only authorized users can log in and access sensitive feedback data.

- **Appwrite Storage**: 
  (Optional if you plan to add file uploads or similar features in the future) 
  If needed, I can integrate Appwrite Storage to allow users to upload files or images alongside their feedback.
